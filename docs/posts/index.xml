      <description>Brew Beer Fundamentals Duration: 0:02:00
Beginning In the brew house, different types of malt are crushed together to break up the grain kernels in order to extract fermentable sugars to produce a milled product called grist.
import json  print(&amp;#34;making beer is fun&amp;#34;)   Step 02: Mash Conversion Duration: 0:05:00
The grist is then transferred into a mash turn
 where it is mixed with heated water in a process called mash conversion.</description>

      <description>TensorFlow Extended(TFX) gives you the power of building a end to end machine learning pipeline. However it is somewhat difficult to grasp the ideas coupled with the actual codebase, and it is non trivial to write an entire machinie learning project from scratch.
The main advantage of using TFX CLI is that you can get a fully working end to end example out of the box. Also, many customizable points are already included such as how to leverage BigQuery, Vertex AI Training/Serving, Dataflow GCP infrastructure.</description>

      <description>Despite modern alternatives like Slack, the ancient [IRC][irc-info] is still hugely popular as an online interactive chat platform.
This may be because there are IRC clients for almost every operating system and device, from the Commodore Amiga to your smartphone, and the technology behind IRC is reassuringly simplistic - it really is just raw text and a few control characters being bumped around the network.
Online servers, such as those offered by [Freenode][freenode], are wonderful for both public and private channels.</description>
