# Brew Beer Fundamentals  

{{< step label="Milling" duration="5:00" >}}

Duration: 0:02:00

Beginning In the brew house, different types of malt are crushed together to break up the grain kernels in order to extract fermentable sugars to produce a milled product called grist.

```python
import json 

print("making beer is fun")

```

## Step 02: Mash Conversion

`The grist is then transferred into a mash turn` 
> where it is mixed with heated water in a process called mash conversion. The conversion process uses natural enzymes in the malt to break the malt’s starch down into sugars.

The mash is then pumped into the lauter tun, where a sweet liquid (known as wort) is separated from the grain husks.

## Step 04: The boil

The wort is then collected in a vessel called a kettle, where it is brought to a controlled boil before the hops are added.

## Step 05: Wort separation and cooling

After boiling, the wort is transferred into a whirlpool for the wort separation stage. During this stage, any malt or hop particles are removed to leave a liquid that is ready to be cooled and fermented.

## Step 06: Fermentation
Duration: 0:11:00

To start the fermentation, yeast is added during the filling of the vessel. Yeast converts the sugary wort into beer by producing alcohol, a wide range of flavors, and carbon dioxide (used later in the process to give the beer its sparkle).

## Step 07: Maturation
Duration: 0:18:00

After fermentation, the young “green” beer needs to be matured in order to allow both a full development of flavors and a smooth finish.

## Step 08: Filtration, carbonation, and cellaring
Duration: 0:22:00

After reaching its full potential, the beer is filtered, carbonated, and transferred to the bright beer tank, where it goes through a cellaring process that takes 3-4 weeks to complete. Once completed, the beer is ready to be packaged (and that’s a whole other fascinating process explained in the video).
